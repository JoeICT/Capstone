Uninsulated wall, I’m cold..
We had some windows replaced this summer, and the contractor - who was hired by the previous owner -0 did an awful job. We’ve corrected most of his mistakes, but one of the bedrooms where the window was replaced is freezing cold, and I just figured out why: there’s no insulation in the area from the window bottom to the floor. What’s the best way to improve the warmth of the room without tearing out the dry wall and actually insulating it? Aesthetics count a bit, though most of the wall is hidden by a desk sitting against it.

Well, there was the electrician who tried to cheat me about 3 different ways then disappeared instead of finishing the job, forcing me to find another electrician to finish things up to get the inspection. Then after 4 months resurfaced and had the gall to demand that I pay him as if he'd finished the work (he got paid a reasonable amount for the work he'd completed), then filed a lien on the house. Obviously, leaving out a ton of detail, but it was a mess. I had my lawyer handle that one.
<br>
Also had the concrete idiot who underbid on the job and thus dragged his feet forever, damaged my gutter downspout, pissed off my neighbor (who isn't reasonable to begin with), nearly destroyed part of my plumbing, and in the end poured the new concrete level, instead of pitched AWAY from the house.
<br>
I've also worked with some very good contractors. There's one guy I've hired a couple of times, and other than he turns out to be pattern blind and had to micromanage the arrangement of tiles his work has been incredibly good.
<br>
In terms of how to be a "good" contractor: do what you say and say what you mean. You tell me something, stick to it. I understand that things happen, but you need to communicate with me. Be polite. Don't be racist or sexist. Do be careful not to damage things, do clean up after yourself. Be explicit about what you WON'T be doing. If you're opening the wall, and you're not going to close the wall afterwards, or paint, or whatever, you need to make that crystal clear upfront. Don't imply. If something is out of your skill set, don't just wing it. I would rather you turned down a job than half-assed it. Don't take a job then no-show.

I've been lucky, and my partner and I have done a lot of work ourselves, but we know when we really need to hire in pros. Mostly the worst of it is people not getting back to us or just being a bit messy--like drifts of cellulose insulation floating down the block after our siding guys had an accident--but the most recent contractor rankled badly in terms of communication.
<br>
We wanted a backwater valve and figured it was a good time to move the sewer cleanout outside. First day of work, two guys showed up, but I had to introduce myself. They left after half a day without telling me that they weren't going to come back the second day (I called and got a lame excuse), then they came back the third day and worked a half day. The initial plan involved hooking up to the neighbor's more updated pvc wye (we share a sewer line to the road and want to replace at a later date), but they didn't do this. I didn't push because I wanted them gone. They dinged the waterline and didn't say anything about it, and seemed angry that I noticed.
<br>
None of my questions were adequately answered the first time, and they were surprised I knew anything about construction--"most people don't want to know with sewers." When I asked about distance of the new line from our neighbor's, the answer was that I could check it online on the as-built map. It's not there.
<br>
There was a form I needed to have notarized with my neighbor upon completion of the work, and when I asked about this, the lead contractor said "my guy said the inspector said you don't need to do it."
Dude must've forgotten that I was standing there when I asked the inspector about it. I had to track down someone at the city to send me the correct link and then verify information.
<br>
I've never left negative feedback on any review site because I think those sites are pretty awful, but man, I was tempted. I later figured out that we were somewhat overcharged for the pleasure, and so I continue to be shy about doing any more sewer work. Knock wood, an inspector signed off on the job, so I hope that the work is at least solid and we don't end up with a basement full of sewer water.

      <div id="res3"><h2><strong><span>What to look for in a contractor</span></strong></h2>
        <p>
          One of the first things to ask for is if they are licensed and if they have general liability and workers comp insurance. Its also a good idea to ask for photos of previous work they have done. If the job is your looking to have them do is no small task you may want to ask if they can provide any references. References can put your mind a little more at ease as you will have spoken to some of there previous customers and you will have a good idea of the type of person they are and the type of work they produce.
          <br><br>
          You may also have access to reviews of the specific contractor or company. Be aware that while all perfect reviews may be a great thing, it could also indicate that the ones leaving the review are not actual customers. Another thing to keep in mind is the time frame that the contractor says they can complete the job. If you get several estimates and one of them says that they will get the job done in a substantially shorter time than all the others that could be a red flag and indicate that they either dont know the actual time that the job will take or that they are just hoping to get the job knowing that it will take longer than they say it will.
          <br><br>
          Communication is another very important trait and this is where you can use some common sense to get a feel for how knowledgeable the contractor is and how there communication skills are. The last thing that you want is to be deep into a job with this contractor and find out the hard way that they dont show up and dont respond to your calls. Plan to gather at least three estimates from various contractors before you make a decision. More quotes (say five or six) will give you a clearer picture of how these companies stack up against each other. Not only will you get more perspective on appropriate costs, but also you'll get an idea of the caliber of work that each contractor will provide. For example, one contractor might offer a bargain rate and marginal work; another's high bid could indicate quality.
